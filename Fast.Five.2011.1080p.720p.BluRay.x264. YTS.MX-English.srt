00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,266
Yo, Jimmy. Give me the status.
Tell me we good.

3
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,101
- You got it, man.
- Beautiful.

4
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,312
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.

5
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,403
All right, fire them up!

6
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:28,738
We go live in five!

7
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,951
It's time for ignition and straight automobile pimping.

8
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,526
- Girl!
- Sorry! My bad!

9
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,992
All right, ladies! We're good.

10
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,119
We're good.

11
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,813
That's it, babies.

12
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,444
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

13
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,238
Wait a second, man.

14
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:30,074
You cats are first wave.
Where's your fourth at?

15
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:33,286
It was Joaquin, but he had to work the graveyard shift.

16
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,747
What? Graveyard shift, man.

17
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,501
- Why don't you run with us, Tej?
- Hell, I'm not running with y'all.

18
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:44,672
I tell you, either you find a fourth
or you don't race. How about that?

19
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:48,259
We should find two, so we don't have
to roll with skirt here.

20
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,600
Whoa, wait a second.

21
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,729
Why don't I find you a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?

22
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,148
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

23
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:04,525
No matter who it is?

24
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:05,777
Yeah.

25
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,408
Yeah?

26
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,410
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?

27
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,413
- I could use the money.
- You got four minutes.

28
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:19,457
I'll be there.

29
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,320
The race starts in four minutes.

30
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,241
All right, girls, let's do this.

31
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,213
- You think you'll win, baby?
- What do you think?

32
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:10,800
- You better. We got rent to pay.
- I know this.

33
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:39,162
I'll get you when you get a car worth racing.

34
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,714
There's our fourth.

35
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,507
Shit. It's Brian.

36
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:23,039
- What's up, Tej?
- What's happening, dude?

37
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:26,167
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem at all, man.

38
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,753
Just remember me when you wax, all right?

39
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,756
They got deep pockets?

40
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,092
Real deep.

41
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,013
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullitt?

42
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,848
What do you say we kick it a nickel?

43
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,519
Nobody mentioned raising stakes.

44
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,652
If that's the case, ask these nice people...

45
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:55,154
to back off the line so you can go home.

46
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,710
Okay. $3,500.

47
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,096
$3,500?

48
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,433
Either that or you can go home, bruh.

49
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,815
- It's all there.
- Better be.

50
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:35,570
Damn, Suki, when are you going to pop my clutch?

51
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,822
As soon as you get the right set of tools.

52
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:39,157
All right.

53
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,638
All right, back up. Let's go.

54
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,183
Back y'all asses up!

55
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,769
Back up before you turn into barbecue around here.

56
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,229
It's not a game. This is serious.

57
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,566
All right, back up.
Get off the street. Let's go.

58
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,654
Back it up. Everybody keep
your heads real clear, all right?

59
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,989
'Cause I got a surprise for y'all this evening.

60
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,911
Go, Slap Jack! Go, baby!

61
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,496
I got this.

62
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,924
Ready?

63
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:42,887
Go!

64
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,356
Oh, hell, no!

65
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,999
You ain't passing me, dawg. Come on.

66
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,919
What you got?

67
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:05,219
I told you, you wouldn't pass me!

68
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,359
Move, bitch!

69
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:09,867
Not tonight, baby!

70
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:11,869
Bend over, boy.

71
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,791
Damn, girl!

72
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,345
Last turn.

73
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:33,141
Too wide.

74
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,154
Home stretch, baby.

75
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,331
Got to go, dawg!

76
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:16,851
Yes!

77
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,697
I can smell you!

78
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,824
Yo, Jimmy, hit it, baby!

79
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:39,123
All right. Y'all see that?

80
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,210
I told y'all I had a surprise.

81
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,837
How you like that for a finale?

82
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:55,348
Bridge.

83
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,516
Yeah!

84
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:43,855
Shit!

85
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:55,658
Oh, hell, no!

86
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,248
Smack that ass!

87
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,815
Yes!

88
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:39,952
I saw that, man.
Bullitt and Suki sprayed the bridge.

89
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,955
I need to start making y'all pay to see this shit.

90
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,792
I got over $10,000 for my man here, all right?

91
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,045
That's what I'm talking about, man.
Play with it.

92
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,006
- Smells good, don't it?
- How about that?

93
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,592
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a good look.

94
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:57,971
This is what you call mutual
respect. All right, let's clear out.

95
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,807
Anybody down for another race?

96
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,142
Shit.

97
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,191
Make sure you bring that body by the garage later...

98
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:13,778
so we can work on that front end of yours.

99
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,072
Watch out.

100
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,700
Maybe I will.

101
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,959
Where are you going?

102
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:31,254
- Time to get out of here.
- Why is that?

103
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,998
Nissan Skyline! Got him!

104
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,885
Shit!

105
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,534
Damn!

106
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,753
Let me see your hands!
Put them up!

107
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,547
Yeah, this is him.
We got him.

108
00:16:07,725 --> 00:16:11,771
So, how long you been in South Florida?

109
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,773
- A while.
- Before that?

110
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:20,154
We know you're Brian O'Conner, formerly of the LAPD.

111
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,116
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

112
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,831
How you doing, O'Conner?

113
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,585
Let's take a walk.

114
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:38,756
Carter Verone.

115
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:42,427
Born in Argentina, but he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

116
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:46,014
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

117
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:49,851
Unfortunately, the cartels have been
successful getting drugs into Miami.

118
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,395
But they've had a hard time getting the cash out.

119
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,272
We've surveilled him for a year.

120
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:57,066
But we haven't been able to put him
and the money together.

121
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,861
- We've swept his house, warehouses...
- Nothing.

122
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,239
Customs here has done a great job of getting us this far.

123
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,366
I'm here to help get them over the top.

124
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,744
I was able to get an agent in undercover...

125
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,079
working travel and logistics for him.

126
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:12,832
Verone's put her in charge of finding new drivers.

127
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:16,377
Right, although we can't confirm her status right now.

128
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:20,340
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

129
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:24,510
She's been in with Verone a year.
Even lives at the compound with him.

130
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:28,723
Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in. I'm against it.

131
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,894
But we need good drivers to put
this asshole and his money together.

132
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,355
You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn.

133
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:37,190
And if I don't?

134
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:40,318
Here's a list of the laws
you broke in L.A.

135
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:44,113
Obstruction of justice, aiding and
abetting. You know the rap sheet.

136
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,784
We can make this all go away in the interest of justice...

137
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,703
if you're willing to play ball.

138
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:57,794
What's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

139
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,212
That's right.

140
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,511
So, Dunn...

141
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,766
looks like we're going to be partners, bro.

142
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:13,726
Tell me, what would be a better motor...

143
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,396
for my Skyline, a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

144
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,027
Twenty four.

145
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:26,489
I didn't know pizza places made motors.

146
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,619
See, man, come on, I can't do this.

147
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:36,165
If this is what you'll give me,
I'll take my chances in Chino.

148
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,043
We'll get someone else.

149
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,504
No way, man.

150
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:46,843
The only way I'll do this is if I get to pick the driver.

151
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:51,055
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

152
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,976
- A dude I grew up with in Barstow.
- Who's that?

153
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,312
Roman Pearce.

154
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:24,589
- That him in the Monte Carlo?
- That's him.

155
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,092
He's got some skills.

156
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,928
And he's crazy as hell, I'm telling you.

157
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,390
In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

158
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:42,857
And he has quite a record, including three years upstate.

159
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,318
Says here, he's on house arrest now.

160
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,987
Can't go more than 100 yards from his home.

161
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,236
He always said he'd be famous.

162
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,950
Pearce!

163
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,577
Roman Pearce!

164
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,540
Whatever happens next, just let it go.

165
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,041
I ain't in it.

166
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,462
Rome!

167
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:55,054
Only my homeboys call me Rome...

168
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,681
pig.

169
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,604
- I'm not a cop anymore.
- Is that true?

170
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,400
Blondie here is not a cop anymore?

171
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,777
That's true. No badge.

172
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,249
Here we go.

173
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,221
You still fight like shit.

174
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:40,224
You better chill.

175
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,603
- Why are you here?
- I'll choke you.

176
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,813
I told you to stay away from me.

177
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:53,112
You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

178
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,906
I told you it wasn't my fault.

179
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,751
Why did you come here?

180
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:12,507
I got a deal for you.

181
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,389
When I needed your ass, you were nowhere to be found.

182
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:23,351
Now you're trying to hand out deals?

183
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:28,815
I need you to come to Miami and drive with me.

184
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:32,193
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and clear your record.

185
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:34,404
I did three years in jail.

186
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,198
Three years over you, Brian.

187
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,035
- I know you better than you think.
- Maybe you don't.

188
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,662
Maybe you don't.

189
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:45,081
You guys finished?

190
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:47,625
Is this deal legit?

191
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,712
That's right.
If you do this job for us.

192
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,297
- I told you.
- Shut up, punk.

193
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:58,886
So you'll clean my record and get this thing off my ankle.

194
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,263
That's right.

195
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,142
I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

196
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:06,811
Why do you think I'm parked so close to the derby?

197
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:09,230
Quit playing like you'll pass this up.

198
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,400
You stupid...

199
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:43,348
Wait. Hold on.

200
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:47,435
Bro, what's going on?

201
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:50,772
I don't know if I should be trusting you, man.

202
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:57,945
Think of it this way. It's an opportunity
for a fresh start. Let's do this. all right?

203
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,074
I wouldn't need a fresh start if it wasn't for you.

204
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,660
You've been using that since you got busted.

205
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:07,121
- Let's just chill out and do this.
- I don't need to chill out.

206
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:10,500
Yes, you do. And you need to stop
blaming me for your mistakes.

207
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,878
Roman Pearce needs to start taking
responsibility for his actions.

208
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:17,507
- You need to go to hell.
- You need to go back to Barstow.

209
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,553
I'm not going back to Barstow.

210
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:36,609
Brian O'Conner, Roman Pearce, meet Monica Fuentes.

211
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:39,445
- They have background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

212
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:41,823
Good.
All right, here's the deal.

213
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,993
Verone's looking for drivers.
I arranged for you two to join.

214
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,370
I also hired some thugs to make it legit.

215
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,622
- When do we start?
- Right now.

216
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,624
What are we driving?

217
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,843
Don't even think about taking the convertible.

218
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:03,886
It might loosen your mousse.

219
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,848
That's cool.
Too much chrome for me anyways.

220
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:11,561
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

221
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:14,439
Check in with us after you meet him.

222
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:19,068
- You okay with these knuckleheads?
- I can handle them.

223
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:22,196
- lf they trouble you, let me know.
- Thanks, Markham.

224
00:25:25,616 --> 00:25:27,285
I ride with you, cowboy.

225
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,495
Why she gotta ride with you?

226
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,748
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

227
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:47,639
Turn right here.

228
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:54,812
- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

229
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,232
How long you been under?

230
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,401
I lost track.

231
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,487
You all right?

232
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,659
You might want to keep your eyes on the road, playboy.

233
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:11,037
- You think we're gonna crash?
- I haven't decided yet.

234
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,710
What are you doing, Brian?

235
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:30,974
He did the "stare and drive" on you,
didn't he? He got that from me.

236
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:08,678
Once we get in here, you're on your own.

237
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:21,983
Look at that one.

238
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,695
Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

239
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,949
Real funny, Fonzie.

240
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,535
Ass.

241
00:27:32,744 --> 00:27:35,496
Roberto, Enrique, I need pictures of the drivers...

242
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,416
their license plates, cars,
and anything else you can find.

243
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:52,805
Let's go.

244
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,561
Keep your mouth shut and follow my lead, all right?

245
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,648
- I got this.
- No, I'm serious.

246
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,401
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

247
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:10,907
Watch your hands, bruh.

248
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:15,286
Go in line.

249
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,829
Let's go.

250
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,173
Carter.

251
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:36,641
- The drivers are here.
- Good.

252
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:38,142
Come on.

253
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:43,523
Stay.

254
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,902
What's going on here?
Tell me.

255
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:51,447
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

256
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,993
My red Ferrari was confiscated.

257
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,620
It sits in an impound lot in Little Haiti.

258
00:28:57,996 --> 00:28:59,998
It's about 20 miles from here.

259
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:04,419
The car isn't important. The package
I left in the glove box is.

260
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:06,921
The first team back here with the package...

261
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,090
will have an opportunity to work for me.

262
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:11,342
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

263
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,553
Nobody has a gun to your head.

264
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:17,307
That's it.

265
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,643
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

266
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:23,896
Before Christmas, guys.

267
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:28,776
Let's go!

268
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:49,797
Come on, cuz!

269
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:54,886
Let's see what this thing can do.

270
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:14,197
Agent Markham.
They're heading south on l-95.

271
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,615
I got it.

272
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,451
They're running. What a surprise.

273
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,672
Stick with me, Rome.

274
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:41,349
Why must I chase the cat?

275
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:56,948
Smart-ass.

276
00:31:04,622 --> 00:31:06,708
You think you're the bomb, Rome?

277
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,915
Let's see if you still got it.

278
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:51,878
I got something for your ass.

279
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,594
Watch this, bro.

280
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:09,729
Shit.

281
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,940
How do you like them apples?

282
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:14,442
Show-off!

283
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:17,987
That's the Brian O'Conner school of driving, baby!

284
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:24,327
Crazy-ass white boy!

285
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,537
Shit!

286
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,068
Bumbaclot.

287
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:01,239
You better get out of the street!

288
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:02,991
That's some bad shit.

289
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:13,960
What do we got?

290
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,923
That's good. Show me his partner.

291
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:24,512
Where are the cars?

292
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:33,104
Stinking boats. Where are the cars?

293
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:46,034
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

294
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,441
- Look in the centre.
- What?

295
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,278
Cha-ching!

296
00:34:22,612 --> 00:34:24,906
- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

297
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:35,124
Shit!

298
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:41,464
- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

299
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,758
Sit on it, Fonzie!

300
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:46,260
What the hell?

301
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:47,887
Shit. Cops.

302
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:49,889
What are they doing here?

303
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:51,683
Rome, no!

304
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,479
Time to go.

305
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:01,943
Son of a bitch!

306
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:05,196
Juvy record
for popping cars. Two years in J.D.

307
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:08,074
Another year for aiding and abetting an armed robbery.

308
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:11,160
He's clean. Dirty, but clean.

309
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,163
All right.

310
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:38,021
Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

311
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:40,189
We hungry.

312
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,987
Sit them by the pool.

313
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:48,323
Nice. Come on.

314
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,085
- What are you checking her out for?
- I'm not checking her out.

315
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:07,467
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

316
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:11,888
- I seen you checking her out.
- Okay, I was. Now shut up.

317
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,474
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

318
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:17,769
Both you girlies shut up.
Unbelievable.

319
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:32,116
You sure are cosy in this big old mansion.

320
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:36,579
Sleeping with the enemy.

321
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:43,836
No, no. Sit down.

322
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,507
Nice Ferrari you got in the driveway.

323
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:51,552
I'm glad you like it.

324
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,976
Darling, will you hold that?

325
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,861
We did all that for a damn cigar?

326
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,698
No. You did that for a job.

327
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:22,291
Do you really think that
I would let somebody impound my car?

328
00:37:26,504 --> 00:37:28,214
The boatyard is mine.

329
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:31,467
By the way, you two owe me a gate.

330
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,720
I'll take it off your cut.

331
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,349
- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

332
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:41,644
- I like that.
- Good.

333
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:44,522
What's this job you got for us, anyway?

334
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:45,815
Come with me.

335
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:47,734
The house has ears in it.

336
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:53,740
I have something I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

337
00:37:53,823 --> 00:37:55,033
What is it?

338
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:57,076
Just put it in the car, drive it to me...

339
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:59,912
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

340
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,914
Any chance of cop trouble?

341
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:05,835
I'm buying you a window of time,
but it won't be open very long.

342
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,339
You make it...

343
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:13,843
and I'll personally hand you $100,000 at the finish line.

344
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:16,679
Make it $100,000 apiece.

345
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:20,391
Look, man...

346
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,685
obviously...

347
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:25,980
your pockets ain't nervous.

348
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,609
- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

349
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:32,862
Like I said...

350
00:38:33,655 --> 00:38:35,031
we hungry.

351
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:49,462
I got an idea. Why don't you boys
join us at the club later tonight?

352
00:38:49,671 --> 00:38:51,547
Yeah. Pearl at midnight?

353
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:54,592
- Get to know each other better.
- Sounds good.

354
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,262
- See you tonight.
- See you.

355
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:03,351
Hey, you!

356
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:09,023
- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

357
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:11,526
I'll take my cutter back.

358
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:19,784
Stupid ass.

359
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:24,956
Hey, man, I figured you had 12 or 13 of these.

360
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,417
You're not too bright.
Get out of here.

361
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:31,587
- You're doing the same stupid shit.
- Get off me.

362
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:35,675
Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people? Stealing his shit?

363
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,469
You think I'd let someone stare me down?

364
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:41,306
I didn't let nobody stare me down in jail, homeboy.

365
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:43,933
You think I'm gonna let it fly on a beach?

366
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:47,270
"And you, I'll take my cutter back."

367
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:49,105
His rich ass.

368
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:52,442
- And you're packing.
- Like you ain't.

369
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:56,154
Exactly.

370
00:39:56,321 --> 00:40:00,074
- From here on, I do the talking.
- You want to do more than that.

371
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:01,576
What does that mean?

372
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:05,455
It means you always get in trouble over a female, Brian.

373
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,886
Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He has everything.

374
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:24,265
Snap-on tools. These lifts are new.
They're only a couple of months old.

375
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:27,185
- Jimmy. What's up, man?
- What's up, Bullitt?

376
00:40:27,268 --> 00:40:29,145
That's Rome there. Do me a favour.

377
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:32,857
When you get a second, I want you
to check out the Evo and Spyder.

378
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,859
Where'd you get an Evo from?

379
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:37,195
- lt's a long story.
- I got you, man.

380
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:38,821
Thanks, Jimmy.

381
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:42,116
It's so hot and humid, I can't even wear drawers.

382
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,910
Tell me about it.

383
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:47,080
Look at all this potential out here.

384
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:50,458
Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

385
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:54,587
Come on, stop that.
I know you're better than that.

386
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:57,507
Damn.

387
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:13,523
Your boy can help put that fire out!
Look at the bubble...

388
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:16,192
- Let's go.
- Serious.

389
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:18,111
Ray, you're making me lose money.

390
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:20,780
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me, now.

391
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:22,407
Come on, Ray. Do it.

392
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:26,244
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

393
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:32,792
Basically, he's the man to know in
Miami. Has his finger in everything.

394
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,877
It's just the way it is.

395
00:41:35,086 --> 00:41:36,921
- What's going on?
- What's up?

396
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:38,506
- How you doing?
- Good.

397
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:40,341
What's this?
What's the latest?

398
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:44,470
It's a work in progress.
It's not finished.

399
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:47,307
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent.

400
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,019
Ray, it's do or die now!
Bring it home, Ray!

401
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,688
Yeah, baby!

402
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,648
Pay up! Pay up!

403
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:58,901
That's how they do it out here?

404
00:41:58,985 --> 00:42:01,154
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

405
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:04,490
Right here. Right now.
You don't look too happy.

406
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:09,037
Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
Thank you. Thank you.

407
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,166
How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.

408
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:16,252
Not too bad.

409
00:42:18,463 --> 00:42:21,924
I see you're about your money,
homey. You race, too?

410
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:27,639
No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

411
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,850
Ever since then, I've just been organising and collecting.

412
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:34,812
Check it out. He'll be in town
a while. Can he use that cot?

413
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:38,358
What's wrong with your place?

414
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:42,487
I don't want to stay with him.
He has bad habits.

415
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:47,867
All right. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

416
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,285
- Thanks.
- Sure.

417
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,081
Who wants a chance to win their money back?

418
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:57,210
So, Jimmy? You ever seen
anything like this before?

419
00:42:57,418 --> 00:43:00,797
No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

420
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,048
What?

421
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:03,925
They got us wired with GPS.

422
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:07,053
That's why Markham knew we were at that impound lot.

423
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:11,391
You the master mechanic.
Can't you just yank that shit out?

424
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:13,935
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

425
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,022
The DIS box, the engine management
system, the main harness...

426
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:20,108
The GPS is spidered into all that.

427
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,734
Tell me something, man.

428
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,320
Do I even want to know where the Skyline is, dawg?

429
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:28,157
Or where you've been or where
the hell you got these rides from?

430
00:43:28,825 --> 00:43:30,827
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

431
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:35,039
Wired so hot, anyone tracking them
knows if you wear your seat belt.

432
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:39,544
All right, Jimmy.

433
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:42,088
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

434
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:43,506
Thanks, man.

435
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:46,259
We need to get these on the street ASAP.

436
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:48,970
Check it out.

437
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:51,889
See that Cadillac across the street?

438
00:43:56,728 --> 00:43:59,605
They've been on us since we left Verone's house.

439
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,827
Elian and Fidel!

440
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:15,955
Can I clean your windshield?

441
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,874
What are you doing, man?

442
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,045
Is everything copastetic?

443
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:25,673
Kiss my ass.

444
00:44:27,216 --> 00:44:28,384
Shit.

445
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:32,639
Let's go!

446
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:41,147
He'll blow our cover before we even get started.

447
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:44,734
- What went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

448
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:46,944
Show me your hands.
Keep them up!

449
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:49,155
- What's this about?
- What's going on?

450
00:44:49,238 --> 00:44:52,617
Hold this. You think you can
shoot at me? I'm a federal agent.

451
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,826
What are you talking about?

452
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,913
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

453
00:44:56,996 --> 00:45:00,166
'Cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us!

454
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:01,959
Get your hands off me!

455
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:04,170
- Lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

456
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:05,922
Don't tell me to shut up!

457
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,341
You almost blew our cover, old man!

458
00:45:08,424 --> 00:45:10,468
You shouldn't have shown up like you did.

459
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:12,553
You didn't know Verone was testing us?

460
00:45:12,637 --> 00:45:14,764
I thought you punks were running!

461
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:17,141
That's great. That's real great!

462
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:21,062
And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

463
00:45:21,646 --> 00:45:23,940
We got to get this under control.

464
00:45:28,903 --> 00:45:30,363
That's mine!

465
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,698
So?

466
00:45:32,657 --> 00:45:36,285
- Tell me what you know.
- We're making a run for Verone.

467
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,204
I'm not sure when or where...

468
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:41,708
but he said he bought us a window,
I assume from the local cops.

469
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,293
I can talk to some guys
at the local P.D.

470
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:47,463
No good. If Verone has some
of them on payroll...

471
00:45:47,547 --> 00:45:49,799
we can't let them know our operation.

472
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:51,175
Exactly.

473
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:55,680
In addition, Verone told us that
he himself will be at the drop.

474
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:57,557
That's good news.

475
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,686
If you're delivering drug money,
we can get him for laundering.

476
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:04,188
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

477
00:46:04,272 --> 00:46:05,565
Fuentes.

478
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:08,067
- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

479
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:10,486
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

480
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,947
What you talking about?
We know what we seen.

481
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:17,160
What do you think, O'Conner?
She's compromised? You should know.

482
00:46:17,577 --> 00:46:20,955
- What does that mean?
- Your pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

483
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,082
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

484
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,085
He gave his mark his car keys and let him disappear.

485
00:46:26,169 --> 00:46:28,504
That's why he's not a cop anymore.

486
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:32,925
So what do you think, expert?

487
00:46:34,177 --> 00:46:35,428
I don't know.

488
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,847
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

489
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:41,100
We're out of here.

490
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:49,567
Let your man go?

491
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,944
Drop it.
I don't wanna talk about it.

492
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:54,906
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

493
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:56,991
Forget about it, cuz.

494
00:46:57,075 --> 00:46:59,202
We got Fuentes in with Verone...

495
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:01,954
Markham trying to blow our cover...

496
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:06,125
and we got two wired cars no better
than that ankle bracelet of mine.

497
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:10,338
I'll tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that again in front of Verone...

498
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:11,798
that'll be our ass!

499
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:14,092
I know, man.
It's getting thick real quick.

500
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,928
We need a way out, got to come up with an exit strategy.

501
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:18,888
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

502
00:47:21,766 --> 00:47:24,227
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

503
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,355
I don't know.
But we need two more cars.

504
00:47:35,154 --> 00:47:36,739
Here they come.

505
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:59,137
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you could join us.

506
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:03,141
We hear you want to get rid of those Cracker Jack toys.

507
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:04,726
No, we figured your cars...

508
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:07,979
deserve better drivers, so we'll take them off your hands.

509
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:09,605
Why don't we settle this now?

510
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:12,483
Wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

511
00:48:12,817 --> 00:48:16,612
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

512
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:18,323
Loser walks home.

513
00:48:18,406 --> 00:48:21,034
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

514
00:48:24,787 --> 00:48:26,706
Let's get these cars.

515
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:32,086
Check it out. There's no way
we'll beat these guys straight up.

516
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,589
That Hemi's putting out about 425...

517
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:38,051
and that Yenko will snap a speedo in five seconds flat.

518
00:48:38,718 --> 00:48:40,845
We have to pull something out of our ass.

519
00:48:40,928 --> 00:48:44,265
I think we should save the spray for the way back.

520
00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:47,268
- Done deal.
- Let's do this, bro.

521
00:48:47,435 --> 00:48:49,687
I'm getting that orange one.

522
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:53,733
You ain't ready, Fabio!

523
00:48:58,071 --> 00:48:59,197
All right.

524
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:02,700
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

525
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:06,663
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line here.

526
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:09,791
First team to go down and back twice wins the race.

527
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:11,876
At which point...

528
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:16,631
the losers will hand over them keys.

529
00:49:16,714 --> 00:49:20,218
Or you'll be eating breakfast through straws from now on.

530
00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:24,973
I get it.

531
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:28,393
This means you, too.

532
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:30,395
I got it.

533
00:49:30,478 --> 00:49:32,563
All right. Let's race.

534
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:40,154
Come on, baby, you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

535
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:43,700
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

536
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:46,744
You about to lose your car.

537
00:49:46,828 --> 00:49:48,955
- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, you got it, man.

538
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:53,251
Think I'm worried about this fool?
This is nothing!

539
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,180
- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

540
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:11,769
Your engine ain't as big as your mouth.

541
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:19,610
Got to smoke him.

542
00:50:19,694 --> 00:50:21,029
All right, here we go!

543
00:50:21,112 --> 00:50:24,115
- lt's all right, I'll handle this.
- Handle it.

544
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:27,994
Ready, and... go!

545
00:50:34,459 --> 00:50:37,253
You ain't ready!
I run these streets!

546
00:50:46,888 --> 00:50:49,474
Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?

547
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:08,701
Oh, shit.

548
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:14,832
Oh, yeah!

549
00:51:19,796 --> 00:51:21,547
I'm gonna get you.

550
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:25,343
Where's your big mouth now?

551
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:27,762
That car's going home with me.

552
00:51:38,606 --> 00:51:40,858
Shit. Eat this, sucker!

553
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:56,207
Shit!

554
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:03,006
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

555
00:52:06,217 --> 00:52:09,137
Sorry, blondie, how does that dust taste?

556
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:13,057
I don't know.

557
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:15,601
Come on, Rome.

558
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:45,381
What the...

559
00:52:45,465 --> 00:52:48,509
Good move, kid.
Let's see if you got the balls.

560
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:12,992
Shit, come on.

561
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,171
Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!

562
00:54:07,714 --> 00:54:09,549
We got two new cars!

563
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,218
Damn!

564
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:22,353
Y'all ain't ready!
Get to walking, Fabio!

565
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:25,815
Use them bus tokens!

566
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,450
- How are you?
- What's your name?

567
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:36,909
We're Mr. Verone's guests.

568
00:54:47,253 --> 00:54:49,172
It's a hoasis in here.

569
00:54:49,672 --> 00:54:52,175
Yeah, lots of potential.

570
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,304
Damn. You got a pen?

571
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:01,601
It's about to get serious.

572
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,771
Look at that girl on the swing.

573
00:55:04,854 --> 00:55:08,983
You guys did something right.
He never socialises with hired help.

574
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,152
Now what's that make you?

575
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,946
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

576
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,199
You and Verone don't go everywhere together?

577
00:55:16,282 --> 00:55:19,077
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

578
00:55:22,246 --> 00:55:25,208
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

579
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:31,339
What is his deal?

580
00:55:31,714 --> 00:55:33,841
He doesn't trust people who carry badges.

581
00:55:33,925 --> 00:55:35,927
You talk like you know.

582
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:42,976
I'd been a cop about two months when
Roman was busted in a garage raid.

583
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:46,938
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each of them hot.

584
00:55:47,021 --> 00:55:48,773
So you busted him?

585
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:52,986
I didn't know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter.

586
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,242
Once I became a cop, Roman saw me
as a friend who became the enemy.

587
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:08,292
Is there anything I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

588
00:56:08,376 --> 00:56:10,420
Just tell them to come join me.

589
00:56:17,343 --> 00:56:19,178
I was admiring this.

590
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:30,189
Damn.

591
00:56:30,606 --> 00:56:33,443
I'm not giving it to you. What's up?

592
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:34,902
He's here.

593
00:56:35,403 --> 00:56:36,946
Where's he at?

594
00:56:37,196 --> 00:56:38,740
He's over there. Don't look.

595
00:56:42,785 --> 00:56:45,872
Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

596
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:47,874
Let's do it.

597
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:50,585
See what I'm talking about?

598
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:55,840
It's all right, let them in.

599
00:56:58,426 --> 00:57:00,637
Go sit down, I'll talk to you in a second.

600
00:57:01,846 --> 00:57:04,057
- How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

601
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,476
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good.

602
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:10,605
She's beautiful, isn't she?

603
00:57:17,362 --> 00:57:18,529
Yeah.

604
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:20,990
She's gorgeous.

605
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,374
You got balls, kid.

606
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,168
I appreciate that.

607
00:57:33,127 --> 00:57:35,296
Women are a powerful force.

608
00:57:36,923 --> 00:57:40,551
You see the blonde sitting with the gentleman right here?

609
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:48,810
Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

610
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:50,728
I love your hair.

611
00:57:50,812 --> 00:57:52,021
Watch.

612
00:57:58,152 --> 00:58:00,863
I wonder where they're going?
Sit down.

613
00:58:03,116 --> 00:58:06,494
So you lit my man's car on fire.
Is that right?

614
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:09,455
Yeah.

615
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:11,708
I did.

616
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:16,713
I got a problem with authority.

617
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,050
I have that same problem.

618
00:58:21,592 --> 00:58:25,388
For me, it's cops in particular.

619
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,527
Let's take a walk. Come on.

620
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,530
- We just got here.
- And now we're leaving.

621
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:44,741
Let's go.

622
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:53,916
Hey.

623
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,126
Come on.

624
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,359
What's all that?

625
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:24,072
We're going to have a little fun.

626
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:32,205
Thank you.

627
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:37,377
- lt'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Yeah.

628
00:59:40,588 --> 00:59:41,839
Hey, Carter.

629
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:44,384
Meet Detective Whitworth.

630
00:59:46,511 --> 00:59:48,429
One of Miami's finest.

631
00:59:49,263 --> 00:59:51,099
Thank you, sweetheart.

632
00:59:51,182 --> 00:59:52,976
You enjoying yourself, Detective?

633
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:54,519
Yeah, I was.

634
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:57,605
I mean, you know me.

635
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:59,148
Yeah.

636
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:01,275
I do know you.

637
01:00:02,986 --> 01:00:04,988
You've been on my payroll a long time.

638
01:00:05,071 --> 01:00:07,657
- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

639
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:12,328
I've got one last job for you.
You hear me?

640
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:14,831
- We've been through this.
- Yeah?

641
01:00:15,164 --> 01:00:17,041
And I said I can't do it.

642
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:21,254
That's the wrong answer.
The table.

643
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:28,886
I'm a detective, Verone!

644
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,057
You do anything to me, the whole
force'll be on your ass in a minute.

645
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:36,269
Shut your mouth, you fat piece of shit.

646
01:00:37,145 --> 01:00:38,730
Stop right now.

647
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:46,487
What the hell?

648
01:00:46,696 --> 01:00:48,031
Sit down.

649
01:00:48,656 --> 01:00:51,409
You're going to regret this.
Stop right now!

650
01:00:51,492 --> 01:00:54,037
Once the bucket gets hot enough, Detective...

651
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,831
the rat is gonna want out.

652
01:00:58,624 --> 01:01:01,461
And the only direction it can go, is south.

653
01:01:05,631 --> 01:01:07,008
Hold that.

654
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:09,052
Get it off me!

655
01:01:09,177 --> 01:01:10,261
I'll forget it...

656
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:11,638
Shut up.

657
01:01:12,513 --> 01:01:17,185
Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

658
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:21,773
You have nothing to worry about when he's screaming.

659
01:01:21,856 --> 01:01:24,609
It's when he goes quiet that he goes to work.

660
01:01:24,692 --> 01:01:26,361
Stop it!

661
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:31,074
You can't be this stupid!
Stop it now!

662
01:01:31,157 --> 01:01:34,661
You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

663
01:01:35,244 --> 01:01:37,747
What I want is a 15-minute window...

664
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:40,541
where everybody, and I mean everybody, disappears.

665
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:43,127
- I can't do it!
- You can't?

666
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:46,506
Stop it.

667
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:48,883
Okay. Monica, come here.

668
01:01:49,217 --> 01:01:50,468
Help!

669
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:52,971
Shut him up.

670
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,848
Help!

671
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:03,481
It's biting me!

672
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:06,359
What?

673
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:10,363
Got something you want to say?

674
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,033
It bit me. Jesus.

675
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:17,453
- I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

676
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:20,289
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

677
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:23,167
Just get it off me.

678
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:24,669
Get it off!

679
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:28,423
You betray me...

680
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:30,925
and my rat here...

681
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:34,387
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn...

682
01:02:34,804 --> 01:02:37,432
your son, Clay, and your daughter, Lexi.

683
01:02:37,515 --> 01:02:40,101
Do you hear me?
Do you understand me?

684
01:02:40,435 --> 01:02:42,228
- Hear me?
- Get it off.

685
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:45,315
I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

686
01:02:48,818 --> 01:02:50,737
Now, you can go.

687
01:02:51,654 --> 01:02:54,324
- Get rid of him. Let's go.
- Get it off.

688
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,668
You boys enjoy the show?

689
01:03:06,294 --> 01:03:09,922
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

690
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:13,968
Be at Versailles Cafe at 6:00 a.m.,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

691
01:03:14,052 --> 01:03:16,012
- You understand?
- Yeah.

692
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:18,097
Don't play games with me...

693
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,059
or you'll be next. All right?

694
01:03:21,684 --> 01:03:24,604
Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

695
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,525
That was a damn rat.

696
01:03:39,202 --> 01:03:43,706
You ever touch another man again, and I'll kill you.

697
01:03:43,915 --> 01:03:45,375
You hear me?

698
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:49,045
Look at me. You hear me?

699
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:58,972
She was into it.
What's that about?

700
01:03:59,555 --> 01:04:02,141
You seen the way she grabbed the dude's head.

701
01:04:02,225 --> 01:04:06,729
She had to. He was testing her.
Her ass is on the line, like ours.

702
01:04:07,605 --> 01:04:09,691
You're feeling this girl way too much.

703
01:04:09,774 --> 01:04:13,444
She's like that trailer rat from back in the day, Tanya.

704
01:04:13,528 --> 01:04:16,656
Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

705
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:19,951
I couldn't let it go to waste.

706
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:21,411
I got you.

707
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:23,496
Is that right?

708
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,499
We go race for cash, but when I step on the gas...

709
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:29,752
my nitrous go blast, leave your ass in the past.

710
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:32,088
Tej, you about to lose your garage.

711
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:33,589
Whatever, man.

712
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:36,342
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

713
01:04:36,426 --> 01:04:39,220
Pay me! Let's go, man.

714
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:41,180
Pay me my money.

715
01:04:41,264 --> 01:04:44,392
I'm glad you're happy.
This is my garage.

716
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:47,395
Royal flush. Give me this, man.

717
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:49,314
Talk to him.

718
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,027
Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

719
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:58,156
Jimmy, how're you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

720
01:04:58,406 --> 01:05:01,409
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

721
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,135
What are you doing here?

722
01:05:19,218 --> 01:05:23,097
They're gonna kill you. I heard him
telling Enrique and Roberto.

723
01:05:23,181 --> 01:05:26,309
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

724
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:28,478
You sure you heard him right?

725
01:05:28,728 --> 01:05:29,771
I'm sure.

726
01:05:37,362 --> 01:05:39,447
Verone's boys is outside...

727
01:05:39,989 --> 01:05:43,910
I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

728
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:51,668
- They don't know. I snuck out.
- What are they doing here then?

729
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:53,753
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.

730
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:56,714
Go stall them for, like, two minutes.

731
01:05:56,798 --> 01:05:58,758
Check her, homey.

732
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,265
Found what you're looking for?

733
01:06:10,645 --> 01:06:13,272
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

734
01:06:15,149 --> 01:06:17,276
Y'all still mad about y'all car?

735
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,279
Don't even trip.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

736
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:24,242
This isn't about being a good cop or doing your job.

737
01:06:24,325 --> 01:06:26,369
They're gonna kill you.
You gotta pull out.

738
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:28,705
Verone pay you to keep a straight face like that?

739
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:32,792
'Cause if I was making money,
I'd remove that mole off my nose.

740
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,877
- Okay?
- Yeah.

741
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:37,130
How much he pay y'all anyway?

742
01:06:37,213 --> 01:06:40,758
Every time I see y'all, y'all got the silk shirts on...

743
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:43,094
jewellery, looking real Miami.

744
01:06:43,594 --> 01:06:48,141
I caught you walking up in the club,
the hamburger meat all hanging out.

745
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:52,603
Don't make that run, Brian.

746
01:06:53,438 --> 01:06:54,856
Be careful.

747
01:07:08,578 --> 01:07:11,706
Where are you going?
You stay right here with us, buddy.

748
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:22,467
Don't even think about it.

749
01:07:34,687 --> 01:07:37,607
Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.

750
01:07:44,489 --> 01:07:47,283
Put the gun down now!

751
01:07:47,575 --> 01:07:49,285
You first, asshole!

752
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,204
I'll shoot the shit out of him!

753
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:59,754
Put down the gun!

754
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,214
Put down the gun!

755
01:08:02,173 --> 01:08:03,800
Enough.

756
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:06,052
Shut up.

757
01:08:07,762 --> 01:08:09,555
It's over. Come on.

758
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:11,599
It's over. Let's go.

759
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,894
It's our gun. Come on, let's go.

760
01:08:20,191 --> 01:08:22,902
I'm glad to see you boys are getting along so well...

761
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:27,740
because tomorrow, Roberto and
Enrique'll be riding along with you.

762
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:30,284
Just so we don't have any problems.

763
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:32,286
I'll see you guys in a bit.

764
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:38,292
What the hell was she doing in there?

765
01:08:49,053 --> 01:08:51,306
Where'd you go this morning?

766
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:53,975
I went to breakfast with some friends.

767
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,190
With friends?

768
01:09:03,151 --> 01:09:05,278
I do have friends, Carter.

769
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:13,119
Okay.

770
01:09:15,121 --> 01:09:16,664
I'll see you later.

771
01:09:26,007 --> 01:09:27,425
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

772
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:29,177
It's my day off.

773
01:09:31,262 --> 01:09:32,972
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

774
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:36,851
Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

775
01:09:36,934 --> 01:09:40,229
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

776
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:42,940
Verone has a plane there and he's taking off for good.

777
01:09:43,024 --> 01:09:44,901
Wait a minute. How do you know this?

778
01:09:45,193 --> 01:09:46,444
Monica.

779
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:49,656
She's doing her job. She warned us.

780
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,199
She warned you about what?

781
01:09:51,282 --> 01:09:53,743
Verone plans to kill us after we give him the money.

782
01:09:53,826 --> 01:09:57,205
Driving into an ambush
wasn't the deal. I'm calling it off.

783
01:09:57,288 --> 01:10:00,625
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

784
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:02,877
No one's calling this off unless I do.

785
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,796
Look, this is real simple.

786
01:10:05,338 --> 01:10:09,676
Make the run, get Verone and his
cash together, so I can move in.

787
01:10:09,759 --> 01:10:12,971
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on you to make you disappear.

788
01:10:13,054 --> 01:10:14,472
Take these.

789
01:10:14,555 --> 01:10:17,976
We're gonna have GPS on you
so you don't get any cute ideas.

790
01:10:18,059 --> 01:10:20,228
And to make sure nothing happens to them, right?

791
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:21,771
Yeah, right.

792
01:10:30,613 --> 01:10:32,365
That guy's a dick.

793
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,370
Let me get this right.

794
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:40,331
If we don't do this, then we go to jail.

795
01:10:40,707 --> 01:10:43,668
But if we do it, then Verone's going to kill us.

796
01:10:43,835 --> 01:10:46,921
- lt's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

797
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:49,966
Maybe it is.

798
01:10:51,509 --> 01:10:55,847
This guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

799
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:00,351
I can think of two reasons why
he doesn't need that money anymore.

800
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:01,811
Here we go.

801
01:11:01,894 --> 01:11:03,313
You and me.

802
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:05,148
Just like the old days.

803
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:09,527
- What do you think?
- They messed with the wrong guys.

804
01:11:12,655 --> 01:11:14,866
- Tej, what's up, bro?
- What's up?

805
01:11:14,949 --> 01:11:16,576
How quickly can you organise?

806
01:11:16,659 --> 01:11:19,454
Look, if y'all really want to carry out this plan...

807
01:11:19,537 --> 01:11:22,999
this is the best place to do it.
What do y'all think?

808
01:11:23,082 --> 01:11:25,668
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

809
01:11:31,674 --> 01:11:33,009
This thing is clean.

810
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:34,302
Distributor cap.

811
01:11:48,983 --> 01:11:53,821
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

812
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:55,990
Sure, but I've already loaded you for spray.

813
01:11:56,074 --> 01:11:58,743
I'm thinking we may need it for something else...

814
01:11:58,826 --> 01:12:01,621
'cause our cars may get a little crowded, you know?

815
01:12:09,962 --> 01:12:12,507
When did you start eating so much?

816
01:12:13,508 --> 01:12:15,385
I was in jail, bruh.

817
01:12:15,718 --> 01:12:18,554
I know how shitty the grub is on the inside.

818
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:22,308
The way things are shaping up out here right now...

819
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:25,603
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there, or dead.

820
01:12:27,105 --> 01:12:30,108
So I'm trying to eat all I can while I can.

821
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:35,029
Plus, the doctor tells me I got a high metabolism.

822
01:12:39,742 --> 01:12:41,744
You remember us growing up?

823
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:44,622
Playing football in the dirt?

824
01:12:45,498 --> 01:12:48,918
Getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

825
01:12:50,128 --> 01:12:53,131
When you got busted, whether I was a cop or not...

826
01:12:53,214 --> 01:12:55,466
if there was anything I could have done...

827
01:12:56,342 --> 01:12:58,219
I would have done it.

828
01:12:58,803 --> 01:13:00,972
I just want you to know that.

829
01:13:01,597 --> 01:13:04,100
Is that why
you let that dude go in L.A.?

830
01:13:06,352 --> 01:13:09,063
Yeah, I think that had a lot to do with it.

831
01:13:11,316 --> 01:13:13,151
When I got busted...

832
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:14,902
it wasn't your fault.

833
01:13:16,112 --> 01:13:19,407
It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.

834
01:13:19,991 --> 01:13:22,035
Wild and out. Crazy man.

835
01:13:23,077 --> 01:13:25,246
No one could tell me nothing.

836
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:26,789
Riding solo.

837
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:28,875
Yeah, well, not anymore.

838
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:36,341
Not anymore, bro.

839
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:03,993
I've got Verone's Navigator leaving the residence.

840
01:14:04,077 --> 01:14:05,244
Copy.

841
01:14:05,953 --> 01:14:08,456
Sir, we've got Verone on the move to the airstrip.

842
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:11,334
Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

843
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:15,421
- Ready.
- Thanks.

844
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:19,175
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

845
01:14:19,759 --> 01:14:22,428
- All set?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

846
01:14:25,515 --> 01:14:26,766
Report.

847
01:14:29,018 --> 01:14:31,145
What's going on out there?

848
01:14:32,772 --> 01:14:33,982
Team One, checking in.

849
01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:36,776
- Team Two, checking in.
- Team Three, checking in.

850
01:14:36,859 --> 01:14:39,028
Team Four, all clear here, too.

851
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:41,489
Team Five, checking in.

852
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:44,117
Team Six, all clear.

853
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:52,250
- Here we go.
- Yeah, so you know what to do.

854
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,377
Stay cool. Keep focused.

855
01:14:54,752 --> 01:14:57,338
Remember the airstrip's off Nallwood Avenue.

856
01:14:57,422 --> 01:14:59,674
It's the third exit after the bridge.

857
01:15:01,342 --> 01:15:02,593
Got it.

858
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,637
You ready for this?

859
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:08,349
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?

860
01:15:08,516 --> 01:15:10,268
I was made for this, bruh!

861
01:15:45,928 --> 01:15:47,221
Come on.

862
01:16:10,828 --> 01:16:13,831
I got activity at Verone's trailer property.

863
01:16:14,248 --> 01:16:17,126
Do not move an inch until I tell you to!

864
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:43,403
Load up.

865
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,490
All units...

866
01:16:47,573 --> 01:16:50,618
move on the trailer property.
Right now! Move!

867
01:16:57,542 --> 01:17:00,461
Shit. Local P.D.
is moving in on our guys.

868
01:17:00,878 --> 01:17:03,381
- Three bags in one car?
- Guess so.

869
01:17:16,769 --> 01:17:18,104
The cops.

870
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,818
I am not going back to jail.

871
01:17:23,901 --> 01:17:26,070
Where are you going, man? Let's go!

872
01:17:27,447 --> 01:17:29,157
What is he doing?

873
01:17:50,595 --> 01:17:54,057
Now let's get the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

874
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,224
You got it.

875
01:17:55,308 --> 01:17:56,351
Lima 2-5...

876
01:17:56,434 --> 01:17:57,977
follow GPS.

877
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,655
Do you know what you're doing?

878
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:14,160
Stay with me, Rome. Come on, man.

879
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,962
I've got them heading south
on l-95.

880
01:18:25,046 --> 01:18:27,131
Bring in the aerial ESDs.

881
01:18:36,766 --> 01:18:37,934
Oh, shit!

882
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:44,148
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

883
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,704
Nice driving, Rome.

884
01:18:57,912 --> 01:18:59,622
I got you, Brian.

885
01:19:04,752 --> 01:19:06,254
Check it out!

886
01:19:18,808 --> 01:19:20,351
What was that?

887
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:32,155
Oh, shit!

888
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:48,588
- Come on, man. Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

889
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:51,966
Just hold the wheel!
Put your hands on it! Hold steady!

890
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,513
What are you doing, man?

891
01:20:52,235 --> 01:20:53,569
Yeah, man!

892
01:21:09,585 --> 01:21:10,753
Hold.

893
01:21:13,297 --> 01:21:15,758
Bilkins, the bird's in place.

894
01:21:19,595 --> 01:21:20,763
Yeah.

895
01:21:22,557 --> 01:21:23,891
We've got Verone's Navigator.

896
01:21:23,975 --> 01:21:26,894
All right. Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

897
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:13,566
You're a good driver, man.

898
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,652
Thanks, bro.

899
01:22:20,531 --> 01:22:24,452
We've got the area blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

900
01:22:33,544 --> 01:22:35,088
What was that?

901
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,090
I've got a visual.

902
01:22:37,757 --> 01:22:39,884
Video should be coming through.

903
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,844
I got it. Looks good.

904
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,348
Where are they going?

905
01:22:53,648 --> 01:22:54,816
Shit.

906
01:23:00,196 --> 01:23:03,491
All right, Miami's finest, let's see what you got.

907
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,369
Come on. Stay with me, boys.

908
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:14,711
Hey, man, everyone's here.
Time for the show.

909
01:23:14,794 --> 01:23:16,713
Let's give it to them.

910
01:23:20,967 --> 01:23:23,845
All right, let the party begin.
Let's go!

911
01:23:42,655 --> 01:23:46,117
This is unit 25-99.
We have the suspects surrounded.

912
01:24:37,919 --> 01:24:39,295
Holy shit!

913
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:47,804
It's a scramble, baby! A big one!

914
01:24:53,768 --> 01:24:55,603
Yeah! Let's do this!

915
01:25:03,611 --> 01:25:05,196
Check this out.

916
01:25:13,496 --> 01:25:15,248
We're not tracking them on the video.

917
01:25:15,331 --> 01:25:17,792
We must have lost them in the scramble.

918
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,544
Yo, let's break.

919
01:25:21,004 --> 01:25:22,171
Yeah!

920
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,675
All right, we got them going west on Beach.

921
01:26:07,759 --> 01:26:09,886
Roger that! I've got them!

922
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,318
Customs has a fix on two cars going west on Beach.

923
01:26:25,735 --> 01:26:27,570
Roger. Follow those cars.

924
01:26:27,654 --> 01:26:29,072
Roger that.

925
01:26:51,177 --> 01:26:52,345
Shit.

926
01:26:53,388 --> 01:26:55,098
They're cornered.

927
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:02,063
Keep your hands where I can see them!

928
01:27:02,146 --> 01:27:03,481
Hands up!

929
01:27:04,023 --> 01:27:07,944
I know my tags are out of date, but damn.

930
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:17,662
What the hell?

931
01:27:18,997 --> 01:27:20,581
Where are they?

932
01:27:42,687 --> 01:27:44,188
How about them apples, man?

933
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:47,358
Yeah! That's some driving
for your ass, baby!

934
01:27:48,776 --> 01:27:49,861
Good job, man.

935
01:27:49,944 --> 01:27:51,946
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever.

936
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:53,990
You're supposed to be
a stone-faced killer!

937
01:27:54,073 --> 01:27:55,908
You were grabbing your seat belt!

938
01:27:55,992 --> 01:27:59,495
Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro.
You're clutch. I owe you big time.

939
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:03,249
Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me.
You really do...

940
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,168
Us.

941
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,795
Suki says you owe us, all right?

942
01:28:10,173 --> 01:28:12,759
- Rome, you there? Come in.
- What's up, man?

943
01:28:12,842 --> 01:28:15,011
Looks like we got just one trick left.

944
01:28:15,094 --> 01:28:17,805
My pleasure, buddy!
Let's do it, baby!

945
01:28:18,765 --> 01:28:20,975
Maybe we should grab Verone while we still can.

946
01:28:21,059 --> 01:28:22,518
No! Not yet!

947
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:25,813
What?

948
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:27,023
You lost them?

949
01:28:27,106 --> 01:28:28,274
Shit!

950
01:28:28,483 --> 01:28:29,942
Those little pricks are running!

951
01:28:30,026 --> 01:28:31,778
It's your call.
What do you want to do?

952
01:28:31,861 --> 01:28:34,405
We're gonna take him down.
He is not leaving here.

953
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:36,783
Enjoying the ride?

954
01:28:37,784 --> 01:28:39,452
It's a fast car, huh?

955
01:28:41,245 --> 01:28:43,414
It's a classic. Old school.

956
01:28:43,873 --> 01:28:45,541
American muscle.

957
01:28:47,627 --> 01:28:51,214
This car can do all kinds of things.
Want to see?

958
01:28:53,132 --> 01:28:55,259
Check this out right here, homey.

959
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:57,637
Hey, what are you doing, man?

960
01:29:07,188 --> 01:29:08,690
Ejecto seato!

961
01:29:09,357 --> 01:29:11,693
It worked! I love this button!

962
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,822
Stay on your toes!

963
01:29:16,948 --> 01:29:20,410
Mr. O'Conner, it worked!
Blow and go. I'm all clear.

964
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:23,204
Meet me at the point!
Hurry up! It's on!

965
01:29:23,287 --> 01:29:24,372
All right. 10-4, man.

966
01:29:24,455 --> 01:29:26,290
Are you ready? Let's go!

967
01:29:36,676 --> 01:29:39,387
Let me see your hands!

968
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:40,722
Freeze!

969
01:29:41,514 --> 01:29:42,724
Clear!

970
01:29:49,105 --> 01:29:52,942
- It's not Verone and Fuentes.
- What do you mean?

971
01:29:53,192 --> 01:29:54,159
Then where the hell are they?

972
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:03,786
Get off at Tarpon Point.

973
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:07,874
Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.

974
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:11,336
Who said anything about an airstrip?

975
01:30:24,515 --> 01:30:25,725
Brian?

976
01:30:26,434 --> 01:30:28,269
What's the hold-up, bro?

977
01:30:28,478 --> 01:30:30,980
- Yo. There's a new plan.
- What the hell?

978
01:30:31,064 --> 01:30:34,484
We meet him at Tarpon Point exit, not the airstrip.

979
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:37,987
- So, what are you saying?
- Like I said, there's a new plan.

980
01:30:40,323 --> 01:30:41,532
Brian?

981
01:30:42,075 --> 01:30:44,118
Brian? Hello, you there?

982
01:30:46,204 --> 01:30:47,288
Damn!

983
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:48,831
What the hell is he doing?

984
01:30:48,915 --> 01:30:50,583
The feds are in the wrong place.

985
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:52,835
Brian's woman is on her own with Verone.

986
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:53,961
So...

987
01:30:54,045 --> 01:30:55,963
So Brian's not coming!

988
01:31:12,105 --> 01:31:14,148
- Let him out.
- Get out.

989
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:22,907
Pop the trunk.

990
01:31:25,368 --> 01:31:26,703
Hurry up.

991
01:31:42,218 --> 01:31:43,469
Where's the rest?

992
01:31:43,553 --> 01:31:45,471
- The other car.
- Another car?

993
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,349
- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

994
01:31:48,433 --> 01:31:50,143
- On the way?
- Yeah.

995
01:31:51,352 --> 01:31:52,603
Here's your money.

996
01:31:52,687 --> 01:31:56,024
So you know nothing about the agents that stormed my jet?

997
01:32:02,905 --> 01:32:06,409
The funny thing is, I only told
one person about the airstrip.

998
01:32:20,798 --> 01:32:24,469
Customs agents sure are getting pretty, aren't they?

999
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:30,516
Put her on the boat.

1000
01:32:32,602 --> 01:32:34,771
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

1001
01:32:49,243 --> 01:32:51,371
Hide the cars and get rid of him.

1002
01:32:51,454 --> 01:32:52,955
Back in the car.

1003
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:22,026
End of the road.

1004
01:33:24,487 --> 01:33:25,905
You know, I like you.

1005
01:33:25,989 --> 01:33:28,950
But I still got to kill you.
It's my job.

1006
01:33:32,537 --> 01:33:33,871
What's that?

1007
01:33:35,331 --> 01:33:36,916
It's Barstow, baby!

1008
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:39,002
It's about to get ugly!

1009
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:48,344
Let's go.

1010
01:34:24,213 --> 01:34:25,465
Come on.

1011
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:53,409
You had me.

1012
01:34:55,578 --> 01:34:57,038
You slipped.

1013
01:34:58,373 --> 01:35:01,125
Eleven and a half months, and you slipped once.

1014
01:35:02,502 --> 01:35:04,295
Put her downstairs.

1015
01:35:10,426 --> 01:35:12,095
See you in a second.

1016
01:35:17,892 --> 01:35:19,227
I thought you was dead.

1017
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:21,479
Me, too. Thanks for saving my ass.

1018
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:22,855
What are you doing?

1019
01:35:22,939 --> 01:35:26,275
If Verone sees a helicopter or Customs boat, she's dead!

1020
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:27,360
Boat.

1021
01:35:27,694 --> 01:35:29,278
Car. Boat.

1022
01:35:29,696 --> 01:35:32,198
You're not gonna do what I think you're gonna do?

1023
01:35:32,281 --> 01:35:35,284
- Yeah, I think so. You got my back?
- Yeah.

1024
01:35:35,368 --> 01:35:36,744
All right, put on the seat belt.

1025
01:35:36,828 --> 01:35:38,621
Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!

1026
01:35:38,705 --> 01:35:41,457
We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome!

1027
01:35:47,964 --> 01:35:49,632
Brian, you're crazy, man!

1028
01:35:49,716 --> 01:35:51,467
What the hell are you doing?

1029
01:36:17,327 --> 01:36:19,078
I think I broke my arm.

1030
01:36:31,966 --> 01:36:33,426
Get the gun.

1031
01:36:54,364 --> 01:36:55,948
It's over, Carter.

1032
01:37:02,997 --> 01:37:04,248
You okay?

1033
01:37:04,415 --> 01:37:05,583
Yeah!

1034
01:37:06,876 --> 01:37:07,960
I'm great.

1035
01:37:14,258 --> 01:37:15,927
We got him, man.

1036
01:37:16,844 --> 01:37:19,430
We got him. Let's get out of here.

1037
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:40,952
Go, go.

1038
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:51,796
That ought to do it.

1039
01:37:52,463 --> 01:37:56,050
So, there were three bags total?
The three from the boat?

1040
01:37:57,051 --> 01:37:58,886
So we're good, right?

1041
01:37:59,262 --> 01:38:00,596
Our records are clean?

1042
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,348
You held up your end.

1043
01:38:02,932 --> 01:38:04,600
Your records are clean.

1044
01:38:22,744 --> 01:38:25,079
So maybe there were six bags.

1045
01:38:26,039 --> 01:38:28,041
I guess we can call it even.

1046
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:29,625
Agent Dunn?

1047
01:38:33,921 --> 01:38:35,840
We found some more evidence.

1048
01:38:38,259 --> 01:38:39,927
Let's take it inside.

1049
01:38:43,931 --> 01:38:46,184
Don't drop the soap, big homey.

1050
01:38:48,519 --> 01:38:51,939
I hope you know when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

1051
01:38:53,274 --> 01:38:55,109
He ain't getting out.

1052
01:38:56,736 --> 01:38:58,154
I'll see you soon.

1053
01:38:58,696 --> 01:39:01,699
- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

1054
01:39:02,909 --> 01:39:05,286
Not for real.
You think he's getting out?

1055
01:39:05,953 --> 01:39:08,456
We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

1056
01:39:08,539 --> 01:39:10,833
There's a sedan out on the road for you.

1057
01:39:10,917 --> 01:39:13,086
Try to bring it back in one piece.

1058
01:39:15,171 --> 01:39:17,674
Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.

1059
01:39:18,675 --> 01:39:20,385
Thanks for looking out.

1060
01:39:22,845 --> 01:39:24,722
Do you trust me now?

1061
01:39:24,847 --> 01:39:26,349
You're all right.

1062
01:39:30,812 --> 01:39:31,980
Sorry.

1063
01:39:33,356 --> 01:39:35,274
Nice working with you, O'Conner.

1064
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,734
Same here.

1065
01:39:48,997 --> 01:39:53,084
I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

1066
01:39:55,878 --> 01:39:57,714
You know what I'm talking about.

1067
01:39:57,797 --> 01:39:59,966
You're going to kick it in Miami?

1068
01:40:00,341 --> 01:40:03,386
I love Miami. Miami is off the hook!

1069
01:40:05,555 --> 01:40:07,598
Open a garage together.

1070
01:40:08,391 --> 01:40:11,227
A garage?
How are we going to do that?

1071
01:40:16,107 --> 01:40:18,192
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

1072
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,532
And we ain't hungry no more, right?
